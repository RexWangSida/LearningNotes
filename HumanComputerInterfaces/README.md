## UI Design Goals - 8 Principles for usability
- **Learnability**
- **Retention**
  - re-establish proficiency, 再次使用这个UI时的印象和熟练度
  - "Memorability"
- **Performance**
- **Error Rates**
  - how severe
  - how easily to recover
- **Subjective Satisfaction**
  - how pleasant to use
- **Accessability**
- **Functionality**
  - range of operation
  - "how much it can do"
- **Trustability**

## UI Design Goals Trade-off
- UI cannot satisfy every usability goal to the maximum extent
- Making the "right" trade-off decisions is critically important to good design
- Make decision on specific target users

## Measuring UI Design Goals
- **Learnability & Retention**
  - Perform experiment:
    - Ask users who have never seen interface before to perform a task
    - Measure how long it take
    - Compute an average
    - Repeat same process a month later

- **Performance**
   - How long it takes a user to perform a task
   - Number of clicks/taps required to perform a task
   - How many tasks can a user accomplish in a time period? e.g. student papers marked per hour
- **Error Rates**
  - Errors per task, errors per time period
  - Success rate at completing task (defacto includes error rate)
- **Subjective Satisfaction**
  - Surveys can help  make it objective
