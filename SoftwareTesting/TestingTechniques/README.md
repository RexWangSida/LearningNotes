# Software Testing Techniques
## [Exploratory Testing](https://www.guru99.com/exploratory-testing.html)
- **Definition: simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution**
- no test cases are are created in advance
- no concept of "completeness"
- not so systematic
- widely used in Agile models and is all about discovery, investigation, and learning

## Specification-based Testing
- **Definition: testing against explicit claims made about it in the specification**

- specification is usually simpler than the software
- specification hopefully capture most of the matters about the software
- Not all specifications are good for testing because there may be no mechanical way to convert an informal specification to test cases.
