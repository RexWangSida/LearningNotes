# Software Testing
## Type of Testings
### Dynamic vs. Static
- **Dynamic Testing**: Testing code by executing it.
- **Static Analysis**: Testing code without executing it.

### Grey-box vs. Black-box vs. White-box
- **Grey-box Testing**: Testing that uses knowledge of the system to design tests for it.(source code inaccessible)

During a grey box test, the person may know how the system components interact but not have detailed knowledge about internal program functions and operation(source code).

- **Black-box Testing**: Testing without any knowledge of the softwareâ€™s implementation.(source code inaccessible)
- **White-box Testing**: sting that systematically uses knowledge of the system to design tests for it.(source code accessible)

### Functional vs. Non-funtional
- **Functional Testing**: Testing that checks whether the program provides some specific functionality.
- **Non-Functional Testing**: Testing that assesses the program on something other than whether it provides some function.

## Fault, Error, Failure
- **Fault**: A **stable property** of the program that can **cause a failure** to occur.
- **Error**: A **bad state** of a **running program** that can **cause a failure** to occur.
- **Failure**: The software does something observably bad.
