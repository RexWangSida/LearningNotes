### Database Design
## Database Normalization
- https://www.guru99.com/database-normalization.html#9
- Normalization is a database design technique which organizes tables in a manner that reduces **redundancy** of data.
## Functional Dependency(FD)
- FD is an assertion about the relation, such that in **R, X → Y**.
  - X functionally determines Y
  - e.g. a → b   then if in table a1 → b3, (a1 → b2 & a1 → b1) are not valid
