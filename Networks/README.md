# Computer Networks & Security
- **Computer network** is a **system** for **communication** among two or more computers.
- Both software & hardware.
- Learn to **develop distributed application** and to **configure and operate as a system administrator**.

## Internet
- End host <-> routers.... <-> server

### ISP - Internet service provider
- End systems/hosts access the Internet throught ISPs
- Types:
  - Tier-1
  - Tier-2
  - Tier-3
  - Local ISP
- Connection type:
  - Custmers and Providers(e.g. Bell and Your PC)ï¼š Customer pays provider for access to the Internet.
  - Peering Relationship(e.g. CA SP and US SP): Peers provide transit between their respective customers and do not provide transit between peers.

  - That means two customers cannot directly communicate with each other, need to use provider and go to higher tiers.
A' to C': A' => A => D => C => C'
  - Tier-1 providers interconnect at public **Networks Access Points(NAPs)**

### Traceroute
- Provides **delay measurement** from source to each router along the end-to-end Internet path towards destination.
- Method:
``` 
    For all i:
      Sender send three packets to router i
      Router i return packets to the sender
      Sender measure the interval between transmission and reply
      Packets sent to router i need to be passed by router i-1
 ```

### Packet-Switching
- **Store-and-forward** Mechanism
- Application message is broken down into packets(encapsulated), each ~ 1000 bytes.
- Each packet **must arrive at a router** before it can be transmitted on next link.
- Individual packet could be forwarded **along different network paths** from source to destination.

- **Loss & Delay**
  - Packets stores in router buffers
  - arrival rate to buffer > output rate from buffer
  - **Loss:** No free buffers
  - **Delay:** 
  ```
  1. Packets queueing in the buffer(queueing delay)
  2. Packets transmit from head of the buffer to the end of the buffer(transmission delay)
  3. Packets traveks on the wires(propagation delay)
  ```
