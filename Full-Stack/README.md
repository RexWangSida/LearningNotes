## Something about web to keep in mind
- Client side error(4) and Server side error(5)
- Request and Response
- Ajax for handling asynchronous web applications, e.g. request and respone without changing html page.
- HTTP request: GET, POST
  - GET: The client side ask for data from the server side.
  - POST: The client side send data to the server side.
